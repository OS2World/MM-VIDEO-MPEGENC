This directory contains source for various utility programs.
To build everything, first edit the Makefile to include the appropriate
Tcl/Tk libraries, and change anything you need to.  Then type 'make.'

None of the programs do very much error checking, so beware.

PROGRAM:	encode_sh
USAGE:		encode_sh -f encode.tcl
DESCRIPTION:	a very simple Tcl/Tk interface to the mpeg_encode program.
		For it to work, mpeg_encode must be in your path.
BUGS:  Only allows files from one directory.

PROGRAM:	ppmtoyuv
USAGE:		ppmtoyuv < input.ppm > output.yuv
DESCRIPTION:	converts a PPM file to a YUV file (encoder format)

PROGRAM:	blockppmtoyuv
USAGE:		blockppmtoyuv base start end skip
DESCRIPTION:	will ppmtoyuv all files baseN where N runs from start to end,
		skipping by skip.  New files will end in .yuv.  Program
		DELETES the original files.

All of the following programs require a Parallax XVideo card to run:

PROGRAM:	playone
USAGE:		playone filename width height start end outbase [quality]
DESCRIPTION:	converts an Xvideo JPEG movie file (filename) of given
		(width, height) into a bunch of ppm files.  Only does the
		frames numbered start to end (frames begin at 1).  Output
		file names are outbaseN.ppm where N is the frame number.
BUGS: may crash after 200 or 300 frames

PROGRAM:	playskip
USAGE:		playskip filename width height start nth outbase [quality]
DESCRIPTION:	same as playone, except does every nth frame beginning with
		start until the end of the movie.
BUGS: may crash after 200 or 300 frames

PROGRAM:	xvideotojpeg
USAGE:		xvideotojpeg filename width height start end outbase [quality]
DESCRIPTION:	same as playone, except instead of outputting ppm files,
		outputs JPEG files.
BUGS: may crash after 200 or 300 frames

PROGRAM:	xvidtoyuv
USAGE:		xvidtoyuv filename width height start nth outbase [quality]
DESCRIPTION:	same as playskip, except instead of outputting ppm files,
		outputs yuv files.
BUGS: may crash after 200 or 300 frames
